The ideal weight of a person based on their BMI can be calculated using the formula:

Ideal Weight
=
BMI×(Height in meters)^2
Ideal Weight=BMI×(Height in meters) 
2
 

where:

BMI is the Body Mass Index calculated using the formula: 
BMI=Weight in kilograms(Height in meters)^2
BMI= 
(Height in meters) 
2
 
Weight in kilograms
​
 
Height is typically measured in meters.
This formula assumes that the BMI is within the normal weight range (18.5 <= BMI < 24.9). If the BMI falls outside this range, it may not accurately represent the ideal weight, and additional considerations may be needed.
